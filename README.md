Part of The Odin Project

Tried my best to copy the landing page from: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png

I feel like I did a pretty good job given how quickly I went through the Flex section; mainly learning this to aid in creating an Office add-in, so not explicitly interested in web design.
